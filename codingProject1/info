project description:

The purpose of this assignment is to give you practice reading and interpreting data in csv data
files. This is the type of work you may have to do to analyze data generated from experiments.
For this assignment we have two tools, tool1 and tool2 that have evaluated 1510 binary files
(programs). The intent of the tool is to detect function boundaries in the binaries. The results of
the evaluation is stored in the csv file in 5 columns:
• name: the name of the binary file
• FP: number of false positives generated by tool – it gave an address that was not a
function start
• TP: number of true positives generated by tool – it gave an address that was a function
start
• FN: number of false negatives generated by tool – it did not list a correct function start
address
• Total – true number of functions
